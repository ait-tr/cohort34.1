    <h1>Elephantidae</h1>
    <p>Elephantidae is a family of large, herbivorous proboscidean mammals collectively called elephants and mammoths.
        These are large terrestrial mammals with a snout modified into a trunk and teeth modified into tusks. Most
        genera and species in the family are extinct. Only two genera, Loxodonta (African elephants) and Elephas (Asian
        elephants), are living.<br>
        The family was first described by John Edward Gray in 1821,[5] and later assigned to taxonomic ranks within the
        order Proboscidea. Elephantidae has been revised by various authors to include or exclude other extinct
        proboscidean genera.
